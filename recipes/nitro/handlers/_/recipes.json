Butter a 21 cm (8,3 or 9 inch) round cake pan. Line with parchment, and butter.\nBring water to a boil in a saucepan. Meanwhile, combine dates, brandy, coffee, and 2 tablespoons cocoa in a heatproof bowl. Stir in boiling water. Let cool, stirring occasionally. Puree cooled date mixture in a food processor (you should have about 2 1/2 cups). Place puree in a large bowl.\nWhisk flour, salt, cinnamon, and remaining 2 tablespoons cocoa in a bowl. Beat butter and dark-brown sugar with a mixer on medium speed until fluffy. Add eggs, one at a time, beating after each addition (batter will look curdled). Stir baking soda into reserved uncovered date puree. On low speed, beat flour mixture into egg mixture in 2 additions, alternating with the date mixture.\nBeat in chocolate and chopped dates. Transfer batter to prepared pan, and smooth top.\nBake until a toothpick inserted into center of cake comes out clean, about 1 hour. Let cool in pan on a wire rack for 30 minutes. Run a knife around edge of pan to loosen, and invert cake onto rack.\nRemove parchment, turn cake right side up, and let cool completely. (Cake can be wrapped in plastic and stored at room temperature for up to 2 days.)\nMake the glaze:\nBring butter, dark-brown sugar, water, and salt to a boil in a saucepan over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally. Boil 3 minutes. Remove from heat. Whisk in cream. Add chocolate, and whisk until smooth. Whisk in brandy. Let cool until thickened, 15 to 20 minutes.\nPlace cake on stand and pour glaze over top, letting some drip down sides. Garnish with halved dates."},{"id":716269,"title":"Peach Carrot Coconut Vegan Pancake","image":"https://img.spoonacular.com/recipes/716269-556x370.jpg","imageType":"jpg","servings":1,"readyInMinutes":45,"sourceUrl":"https://www.afrolems.com/2015/04/20/peach-carrot-coconut-vegan-pancake/","summary":"Peach Carrot Coconut Vegan Pancake might be a good recipe to expand your breakfast recipe box.

Add the remaining raw clams and reserved clam cooking liquid to the pan. When adding the liquid, be sure to check for sand and grit in the bottom, you may lose the last couple of tablespoons of juice but that is better than sand in your pasta! (Meg note: even though I followed the directions, next time I might strain the juice through a paper towel lined sieve to make sure all of the sand and grit is out, before adding it back into the pan.) Cover and cook until the clams open.\nWhile clams are cooking, drop the linguine into the salted boiling water and cook until the pasta is very al dente  maybe a minute or so less than the box directs.\nRemove the cooked clams in their shells from the pan and keep warm. Add the butter and cooked clams that have been removed from their shells back to the pan. Bring the liquid to a boil and toss in the cooked pasta and the herbs. Cook the pasta together with the sauce until the sauce clings to the pasta. Turn off the heat and toss in the grated parmigian-reggiano, if using. Stir vigorously to combine.\nDivide the pasta into serving dishes and garnish with clams that are still in their shells and some chopped herbs.\nNote: Purchase shellfish thats sold in mesh bags.
